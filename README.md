# Space-Scroll-Shooter
My introduction to the C# and .NET

My first "game" written in C# WPF.
In this project I used simple class hierarchy to all objects in the screen. All object has his own speed, angle of moving, model and hitbox.
The player should destroy all enemies, don't let them reach bottom of the screen, evade projectiles and collect bonuses.
If enemy bashes into player he destroys and causes some damage to the player. If he reaches the bottom border, then deals dmg X2 and respawns at the top.
There are special boss levels, where you need to defeat the big guy, trying to avoid his special attacks.
After every Boss battle you enters a shop, where you could buy new weapon and repair using your current score as currency.

Use left and right arrows to move spaceship and space to shoot.

What are you waiting for? Get abroad and prepare to defend our planet, captain!
